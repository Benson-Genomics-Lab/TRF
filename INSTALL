To compile TRF, you will need a C compiler (e.g., gcc, clang) with the standard library installed. We have tested compiling and installing TRF under UNIX-based systems (Linux, macOS) and for Windows under Cygwin/MinGW.

Brief instructions:

```
# Check actual version
tar xzvf trf-4.09.tar.gz
cd trf-4.09
mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make
# To install to system
sudo make install
# To copy binary elsewhere
cp src/trf DESTINATION
```
